# Project Description

This project demonstrates numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It includes implementations of the Euler method, the second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) method, and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The project consists of several Python files, each containing specific functionalities.

## Files

1. **diff_equations.py**: This file contains the definitions of differential equations used in the project.
2. **numerical_methods.py**: This file includes implementations of numerical methods for solving ODEs, namely the Euler method, the second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) method, and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.
3. **main.py**: This is the main script that imports functions from other files, defines input data, and computes solutions for differential equations using different numerical methods.

## Usage

1. **diff_equations.py**: You can define your own differential equations in this file by adding functions similar to `diff_eq1` and `diff_eq2`.
2. **numerical_methods.py**: This file contains functions for numerical methods. You can use these methods to solve differential equations defined in `diff_equations.py`.
3. **main.py**: This script serves as the entry point to the project. You can define input data, such as initial conditions and step sizes, and compute solutions for differential equations using different numerical methods.
